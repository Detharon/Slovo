# Slovo

A simple JavaFX application that counts word occurences in text files, backed up by an embedded database to store all the necessary data.

Executable can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqzo7255ly7ci31/slovo-0.11.jar?dl=0).

# Usage

Click on the File -> Open and choose the desired file. It will be automatically processed and the results will be stored.
This way, for example, you can generate the frequency lists based on the book in foreign language, so that you're well prepared to read it.
Afterwards, either remove the data, or combine it with new text files.
